        Computer Science Engineering is a course that deals with design, implementation, and management of information systems of both software & hardware processes. A computer scientist specializes in theory of computation and design of computational systems. Computer Science engineering aids with various disciplines such as electrical and electronics engineering, information technology, software engineering, and more. 
        Computer Science Engineering courses are offered at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in the form of B.E, B.Tech, or M.Tech degree programmes. B.Tech in computer science is popular at UG, whereas M.Tech in computer science is popular at PG levels After completing a degree programme in computer science, candidates can find various entry-level jobs in the IT industry or related fields, given they fulfill the required skill set such as knowledge of subjects like programming, database management, data structures and more.

    <h2>AI</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[a] Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving", however this definition is rejected by major AI researchers

    <h2>IoT</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects), that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies, and that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.[1][2][3][4]
        The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning.[1] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of Things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. The IoT can also be used in healthcare systems
